Web application developed for the Project II subject in the second year of the Technologies and Information Systems for the Web course, licensed at ESMAD (Superior School of Media Arts and Design).

## Description

MobileTicket is a Web application that allows a user to withdraw a ticket from a service of a company.

It uses GPS-based location to know if the user is on the proximity of the company and not on the other side of the world.
The thought while making this application was the waiting line when we try to get something in a supermarket, if we can access all the time the current ticket being attended we can shop instead of waiting in line.

There are 3 types of users, admin, employee and client(or customer).

The admin can:
 - Change any services current number;
 - Get a ticket history of all the tickets withdraw at any time;
 - Add/Remove services;
 - Modify waiting time of a service;
 - Add/Remove/Edit employees that are associated with the services;
 - Modify the companys GPS coordinates;
 - Modify maximum distance that a user can withdraw a ticket.
 
 The employee can:
 - Change the service number that he is associated with;
 - Get a list of how many people are still waiting;
 - Get a ticket history of tickets withdraw on that service;
 
 The client can:
 - Withdraw a ticket of the service he wants;
 - Access a ticket history of all the tickets withdraw by him;
 - Change the name, email and password associated with the account.
